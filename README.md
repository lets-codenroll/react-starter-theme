# React Starter Theme

The React Starter Theme serves as a boilerplate for developing scalable and maintainable React web applications. It is designed to streamline the initial setup, providing developers with essential tools and configurations to kickstart their projects efficiently.

## Goals and Objectives

- Deliver a lightweight and efficient starter for React projects.
- Simplify the setup process with a pre-configured structure.
- Leverage React Router and React Context API for navigation and state management.
- Provide a foundation that is easily customizable for various use cases.
- Ensure compatibility with industry standards while maintaining flexibility for customization.

## Key Features

1. Routing and Navigation
2. Global State Management
3. Styling with Sass
4. Modular File Structure
5. Git Integration

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
